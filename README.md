CloudFoundry PHP example application:  Wordpress
================================================

This is an example application which can be run on Cloudfoundry using the [PHP Buildpack](https://github.com/dmikusa-pivotal/cf-php-apache-buildpack.git).

This is an out-of-the-box implementation of Wordpress 3.5.2.  It's an example of how common PHP applications can easily be run on CloudFoundry.

Usage
-----

Clone the app and push it to CloudFoundry.

```
git clone https://github.com/dmikusa-pivotal/cf-ex-worpress
cd cf-ex-wordpress
```

Not edit ```htdocs/wp-config.php``` and change the [authentication keys](https://github.com/dmikusa-pivotal/cf-ex-worpress/blob/master/htdocs/wp-config.php#L49).  These should be uniqe for every installation.

```
cf push --buildpack=https://github.com/dmikusa-pivotal/cf-php-apache-buildpack.git
```
